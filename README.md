#libplotty


This is a simple plot library based on an example in the book “C++ GUI Programming with Qt 4” by Jasmin Blanchette and Mark Summerfield
([Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131872494)).

The example was enhanced with a few features like different curve and line styles as well as different point markers and baseline graphs.
